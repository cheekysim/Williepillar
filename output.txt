 Rapid Application Development (RAD) is a software development methodology that uses an iterative and incremental approach to software development.

The main idea behind RAD is to develop software quickly by using pre-developed components and by reusing existing code. This approach allows for a more rapid development cycle, as well as a higher level of flexibility and adaptability.

RAD is a good choice for projects where the requirements are subject to change or are not well understood. It is also good for projects where time to market is a major consideration.

The main disadvantages of RAD are that it can be more expensive than other development methodologies, and it can also result in lower quality software.

Despite its disadvantages, RAD is still a popular choice for many projects, especially those that are time-critical.
